California Speed, a card game python game made by Lisa Hachmann and Dimitar Dimitrov.

The game goes as follows: 
This game is for 2 players only, unless the rules are modified. 
Each player get an equal portion of the deck, with no extra cards, and they cannot look at their cards. The players each lay down 4 cards, in a 2x4 setup, face up. At their count, they start by placing new cards on top of all doubles/triples/possible quadruple cards that are in front of them, continously (as they set down new cards, new doubles etc show up- keep playing) until there are no more doubles left OR one player has run out of cards. If there are no doubles left, each player collects the piles of their original 4 cards and repeats the process. The winner is the player with no cards left. 

To run this program, you need:
Python 2.7
Pygame (sudo apt-get install pygame)
